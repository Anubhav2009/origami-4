 This is how to make an origami bird. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1: Start with a square piece of origami paper. I recommend using real origami paper, but if you only have regular 8.5x11 paper, follow these instructions to make a square sheet. If you have a two sided origami paper, have the lighter color side face up.       
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2: Fold the paper in half by folding the left side over to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 3: Simply unfold the paper. This is so we can have the crease in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 4: Fold the lower half of both sides to line up with the center.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 5: Fold the top part back so that all you see are the previously folded flaps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 6: Grab the top corners of both sides and fold them to to the center.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 7: Now unfold them. Just like before, this is so we can get the crease.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 8: This step is a little tricky but it's not hard.

First, peel open the left flap from the center like you see in the first picture in this step.

Then, take the corner of that flap and pinch both sides of it as in the second picture.

After pinching the sides together to meet at the corner, you can procede to crease the left edge to enable you to fold the whole piece down like you see in the third picture in this step.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 9: Do the same thing to the right side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 10: Take the bottom corners of each flap and fold it 3/4ths of it backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 11: Now fold the whole piece in half by folding the right side under the left.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 12: Rotate the paper counter-clockwise (left) just a little bit and you'll see the bird taking shape.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 13: Grab about a third of the head and fold it down sideways. This will prepare you for the next step.
   
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 14: Now open the top corner so you can push the head in to where you creased it in the previous step.

Then do an inside reverse fold so the head will sink in, and crease the left and right sides together to hold it in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 15: Fold the tail up about 2/3rds of the way and fold another portion of it back out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 16: Unfold the whole bird and fold the tail in where your bent it earlier. Remember to also fold the smaller part of the tail out 
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 17: Go ahead and fold the bird in half and back together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 18: Grab the end part of the tail and pull it downwards so the bottom of the whole tail lines up. Then crease it so it stays that way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 19: If you did the legs right, your origami bird should be able to stand up.
